Follow Auth0's SPA approach vs. follow server side approach which redirects user to diffrent paths 

Considerations 

- user state maintained when moving between paths?
    - conclussion not significant

- which fits into HStream's moto more 

Conclussion: use SPA for now since this enables more dynamic assigning of user info without page reloads
